## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### 1. **Two Industries Approach**
- ✅ **Coffee Shop** (Hospitality)
  - 3 staff roles: barista, waitress, manager
  - 5 service-focused scenarios
  - Real customer personas
  
- ✅ **Web Studio** (Technology)
  - 3 tech roles: designer, developer, project manager
  - 5 project-focused scenarios
  - Real client personas

### 2. **Supabase-Ready Naming**
- ✅ All fields in snake_case for direct PostgreSQL compatibility
- ✅ Meaningful ID names with `_id` suffix
- ✅ Enum types for statuses and roles
- ✅ JSON arrays for many-to-many relationships
- ✅ Standard timestamps: `created_at`, `updated_at`

### 3. **Assessment Thread Workflow**
```
PENDING → ACTIVE (initial_response) 
       → ACTIVE (feedback_round_1)
       → ACTIVE (feedback_round_2)
       → ACTIVE (final_decision)
       → COMPLETED / PASSED / FAILED
```

### 4. **Comment Threading**
- Parent-child relationships for nested replies
- Comment types: `response | feedback | resolution`
- Stages for workflow tracking
- Recursive building of comment trees

## 📈 Next Steps for Supabase Deployment

### Phase 2: Database Setup
1. Create Supabase project
2. Create tables using schema from `NETWORK.md`:
   - characters
   - organizations
   - posts
   - comments
   - assessment_threads

3. Set up relationships:
   - organizations → characters (FK)
   - posts → characters (FK)
   - posts → organizations (FK)
   - comments → posts (FK)
   - comments → characters (FK)
   - assessment_threads → organizations (FK)
   - assessment_threads → characters (FK)
   - assessment_threads → posts (FK)

4. Create indexes:
   - `organizations.id`
   - `posts.organization_id`
   - `assessment_threads.organization_id`
   - `assessment_threads.candidate_id`
   - `comments.post_id`
   - `comments.parent_id`

### Phase 2: Authentication
- Add Supabase Auth
- User session management
- Role-based access control

### Phase 3: Real-time Updates
- Replace mock data with Supabase queries
- Implement real-time subscriptions
- Add loading states

### Phase 4: Features
- Video recording for assessment artifacts
- AI-powered feedback
- Mobile app
- Analytics dashboard
