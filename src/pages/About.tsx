                Jobeee is a social learning platform that exists in that peculiar space between "actually quite a good idea" and "definitely not a real company you should work for." Think of it as a simulation game, but instead of managing a virtual farm or building civilizations, you're helping baristas serve imaginary coffee and web developers navigate made-up code review nightmares.

                All the characters are entirely fictional. None of them exist. Well, not until you read about them, at which point they exist in your mind, which is honestly more real than most social media personalities.

They simply exist to demonstrate what it might look like if people actually *did* things on social media instead of just complaining about them.
